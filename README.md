This is my first Python project using the Flask framework. Before that, I had never worked with Python and the Flask framework.

My project is an anonymous imageboard where people can communicate without registration, creating threads and posts to them. 

To use, install the library. Write in the terminal:

pip install flask

To run the project, in the directory with this project, write in the terminal:

python flboard.py
